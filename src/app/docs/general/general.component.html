		<h1>What is Mamba UI?</h1>
		<p>
			Mamba UI is a free, open-source collection of beautiful UI elements based on Tailwind
			CSS that make it easy for anyone to build a website in minutes.
		</p>
		<p>
			We wanted to make beautiful, customizable UI design elements that anyone can use to
			build their next website & influence its look & feel. So now, you get a full range of
			building blocks that you can combine to create your own style. Your next website will be
			a breeze. Whether it's an e-commerce website or your own personal blog, Mamba UI is the
			fastest way to create your next beautiful website in minutes.
		</p>
		<p>
			With Mamba UI you can create a new website in minutes. What used to take hours, can now
			be done in a few clicks. We include over 40+ building blocks that can help you create
			almost any type of page.
		</p>
		<p>
			Have you ever thought about how easy it would be to create a website if you could just
			assemble parts from an inventory? It's kind of like playing with LEGO, but not as messy.
			A little bit ago, I started working on my own little project called Mamba UI which is a
			set of building blocks that I love to use for bootstrapping my next websites.
		</p>
		<p>
			All the components are just good ol' HTML and CSS, but without the need of writing
			complex css rules thanks to
			<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS
			framework so if one of our components doesn't fit your needs just right, you can modify
			them easily by following the Tailwind CSS
			<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs">documentation</a>.
