			Get a jumpstart on creating your new webpage with our fully responsive and carefully
			styled components and sections. You can get the layout of your website done with just a

			All the components are just good ol' HTML and CSS, but without the need of writing
			complex css rules thanks to
			<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS
			framework so if one of our components doesn't fit your needs just right, you can modify
			them easily by following the Tailwind CSS
			<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs">documentation</a>.
