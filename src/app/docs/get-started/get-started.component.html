		<h1>Getting started</h1>
		<h2>How to use the components on your own websites?</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Find something that you like from the
				<a [routerLink]="['/components']">components</a>,
				<a [routerLink]="['/sections']">sections</a> or
				<a [routerLink]="['/templates']">full pages</a>.
			</li>
			<li>Choose the primary color from the Tailwind CSS color palette</li>
			<li>Select the light or dark theme</li>
			<li>Click the HTML, Vue or JSX -buttons to see the code for the selected part</li>
			<li>Copy/paste into your project</li>
			<li>Profit!</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>
			Since everything you see on this page is built with Tailwind CSS you'll need to have it
			installed for the components and sections to work out-of-the-box on your website. They
			have an extensive
			<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">installation guide</a> in their docs
			for all sorts of different tools and frameworks. If you want to quickly test the
			components or customize the code, you can also copy them to Tailwind CSS's official
			online playground <a href="https://play.tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind Play</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tailwind CSS has 17 different colors in total but by default only
			<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#overview">8 of them</a> are
			available in the configuration. We have inlcluded all the available colors in the
			<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-palette-reference"
				>Tailwind CSS color palette</a
			>
			so you can try all of them out. If you use one of the colors that isn't in the default
			configuration you will need to add it to your tailwind.config.js file.
