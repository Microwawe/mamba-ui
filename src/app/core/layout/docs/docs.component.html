		<h1>Create a beautiful website in minutes</h1>
		<p>
			Get a jumpstart on creating your new webpage with our fully responsive and carefully
			styled components and sections. You can get the layout of your website done with just a
			couple of clicks.
		</p>
		<p>
			All the components are just good ol' HTML and CSS, but without the need of writing
			complex css rules thanks to
			<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS
			framework so if one of our components doesn't fit your needs just right, you can modify
			them easily by following the TailwindCSS
			<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs">documentation</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Idividual components that can be re-used multiple times in your designs.</li>
			<li>
				Pre-made building blocks that you can stack on top of each other like Legos to build
				a website of your own in minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Full templates that showcase pieces of what you can achieve with the building blocks
				that are in this UI Kit.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How to use the components on your own websites?</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Find something that you like from the
				<a [routerLink]="['/components']">components</a>,
				<a [routerLink]="['/sections']">sections</a> or
				<a [routerLink]="['/templates']">full pages</a>.
			</li>
			<li>Choose the primary color from the available colors in the footer</li>
			<li>Select the light or dark theme</li>
			<li>Click the "HTML"-button to see the code for the selected part</li>
			<li>Copy/paste into your project</li>
			<li>Profit!</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
		<p>
			Since everything you see on this page is built with TailwindCSS you'll need to have it
			installed for the components and sections to work out-of-the-box on your website. They
			have an extensive
			<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation">installation guide</a> in their docs
			for all sorts of different tools and frameworks. If you want to quickly test the
			components or customize the code, you can also copy them to TailwindCSS's official
			online playground <a href="https://play.tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind Play</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also if you want to use the exact same icons as I have, you'll need to install
			<a href="https://icons.coreui.io/">CoreUI Icons</a> as well. And most of the text on the
			site uses the
			<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">Montserrat</a> font-family.
		</p>
		<p>
			This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the creators of the TailwindCSS
			framework.
